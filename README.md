## About the Quiz

The quiz has a timer that counts down from 40.  There is a link to the highscore page at the top.  In the middle of the page is the game window with a start button.

Once the start button is clicked the timer will appear at the top of the page and count down.  The game will start and you will be asked a multiple choice question.  Once you click on the answer you think is correct a "Next" button will appear.  The game will send an alert if you get the answer correct.  Click on the next button to advance to the next question.

The game will continue until all questions have been answered or until the timer hits zero '0'.  Once the final quetsion is answered the game will stop and the time that is remaining will be your score.  A "Try Again" button will appear along with an area to input your initials and a "Record" button to save your score.

After you have played a game if you want to see the last score that was recorded you simply hit the highscore button at the top of the page.  This will take you to the high scores and you can see the latest score that you got.  Feel free to try to beat your time and get all the answers correct!
